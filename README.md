## Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive analysis of Blinkit's retail sales data across India, enabling stakeholders to visualize sales distribution by outlet characteristics, product categories, and regional performance. The solution facilitates data-driven decisions for inventory optimization, outlet expansion, and customer experience enhancement.

## Technologies used
Power BI: Primary platform for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard development

Advanced Excel: Used for comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing

File Formats: .pbix (Power BI project files), .png (dashboard snapshots)

## Business Context
Blinkit operates diverse retail formats across multiple cities, facing challenges in identifying high-performing product categories, outlet types, and regional sales drivers. Without granular insights, optimizing inventory allocation, store placement strategies, and product assortment efficiency remains suboptimal.

## Project Objectives
Develop an interactive analytical tool to:

Identify top-performing items and outlet locations

Analyze sales patterns by outlet size and city tier

Evaluate fat content's impact on product performance

Enhance decision-making through regional and category-level metrics
